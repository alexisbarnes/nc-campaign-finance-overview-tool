# NC Candidate Campaign Finance Overview

This tool will give you a sweeping overview of a candidate who files their finance report to the [North Carolina Sate Board of Elections](https://www.ncsbe.gov/index.html). It will only work with a CSV format of the data that has not had the headers modified.

*This was created with the intent of learning how to work with csv data and Javascript.*

## How To Get It Running
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have the most recent version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
3. In your terminal, go the this cloned directory on your computer.
4. Run python -m http.server to run a local server.
5. Upload your csv.

### If you run into errors
There is example data in the /data folder. Check to see if your headers match up with that dataset.

The tool [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) was used for this project.
